# MeCard
Flutter app about your personal details

This app is digital conversion of your Identity Card.

For this project I use different widgets of Flutter like:

CircleAvatar - For my image with round image.
Text - For text
Column - For vertical contain
SizedBox - For creating space between widgets
Card – For creating material design card
ListTile – For creating the list of Tiles (About Yourself)
Divider – For creating a divider line

This is how app looks like.
